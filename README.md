Method Analyzer is a lightweight static analysis tool written in Java that scans Java source files and extracts method-level metrics using heuristic parsing. The analyzer detects valid method declarations, counts parameters, identifies getters and setters, and filters out control structures such as conditionals and loops.

The project intentionally avoids full AST parsing and compiler-level analysis, focusing instead on practical source-code inspection techniques, defensive string parsing, and well-defined architectural layers (input, parsing, analysis). This approach emphasizes correctness, scope control, and clarity of design over language-specific complexity.
